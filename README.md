# Track-Your-Spending

I needed a simple android app which would allow me to see my spendings in a nice unified (across different accounts) list and in 3 major categories... 

So I created this.

After using the app I added several new features such as: 
* the ability to forecast the food category
* importing / exporting the database file
* including goals for each month
